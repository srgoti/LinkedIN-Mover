## Because I *hate* the way LinkedIn saves images in the common pictures dir on android

Currently, when you download an image from the LinkedIn app on android, the image saves as Pictures/_random uid_.jpg, this project aims to move these files to Pictures/LinkedIn/_the same random uid that doesn't mean anything ~~(copy)~~.jpg_ while avoiding duplicates by appending "**(copy)**" to the filename
